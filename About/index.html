        <p>Hi, my name is Yunessa Rodriguez and I'm so excited to be taking this class this semester! I'm currently
            a Junior studying Creative Technology and Design at CU Boulder. I took a small web
            course prior to this class, so I can't wait to see what other aspects of web I get to learn here. </p>

        <p>I grew up as a military brat, so I've gotten to experience many things around the world. I was born in Korea, 
            and I moved to Germany when I was 4, to Colorado when I was 10, to California when I was 12, and I moved back 
            here after I turned 15. I primarily live in Colorado Springs, and I absolutely love it there. I'm a big fan of 
            exploring new places, and it's fascinating how much there is to do in Colorado.

    <section id="Interests">
        <h3>My Interests</h3>
        <p>It's almost impossible to live in Colorado without loving the outdoors. I enjoy hiking new trails and finding 
            cool spots locally. 
        </p>
        <p>Being in CTD, I would also consider myself to be a decent artist. I've always wanted my art to serve a purpose
            and make an impact, and I'm hoping to be able to find my thing here. Currently, I draw memorial portraits for 
            those who have lost loved ones. Although it's slightly morbid, it almost feels like bringing their living presence
            back while emphasizing the smallest details of their features. 
        </p>

        <p>I also have a lot of other random smaller hobbies. I'm the kind of person who sees someone do something cool, 
            and I will spend the next few weeks trying to learn that skill myself. I've dabbled in piano, guitar, crotcheting, 
            badminton, gaming, and more. I also absolutely love to bake and cook. Making food has always been a huge part of my
            culture, and it feels like a way of sharing it with other people. I like to bring a little bit of my creativity with 
            me every day, whether that's creating a new recipe or trying a crazy makeup look.

    <section id="Goals">
        <h3>My Goals</h3>
        <p>Every day in itself is filled with a list of goals for myself. Like most people, I want to be successful and make an impact.
        </p>

        <p>Success to me however, may appear differently than it does for most people. Since I was young, I struggled heavily with
            my mental health, and goal setting felt impossible when I couldn't even picture the next day. Living in that mentality on the 
            daily forced me to make smaller goals for myself everyday rather than trying to put together the bigger picture. I recognize
            that there are millions of people in this world who are on the same boat as I am, and more than anything I want to prove that 
            we are capable of being more than how our health defines us. I want to be able to <i>create</i> anything and everything I can 
            in this life time that forces people to turn their head for a moment and <i>think</i>. This is what I absolutely love about CTD. 
            Not only is there a strong focus on the aspect of creation, but there is a focus on impact. I'm not sure exactly what it is i'll
            end up doing, but I do know that I can't picture only doing one thing during this lifetime. 
        </p>
