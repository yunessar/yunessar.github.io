        <p>Hi, my name is Yunessa Rodriguez and I'm so excited to be taking this class this semester! I'm currently
            a Junior studying Creative Technology and Design at CU Boulder. I took a small web
            course prior to this class, so I can't wait to see what other aspects of web I get to learn here. </p>

        <p>I grew up as a military brat, so I've gotten to experience many things around the world. I was born in Korea, 
            and I moved to Germany when I was 4, to Colorado when I was 10, to California when I was 12, and I moved back 
            here after I turned 15. I primarily live in Colorado Springs, and I absolutely love it there. I'm a big fan of 
            exploring new places, and it's fascinating how much there is to do in Colorado.

        <h3>Yes, I'm Employed</h3>

        <p>I've been working in the food industry since I was 15. If you know anything about the restaurant industry, you know
            that you'll meet plenty of interesting people and you have to learn how to adapt and work with them. Even though it's not 
            a coorperate job, the skills that I learned will definitely follow me for the rest of my life. You learn which methods of communication
            work best for different personalities, you learn how to de-escalate problematic situations, you learn how to sell products to consumers,
            and as an artist, you learn that making things "look pretty" really does make a difference. Currently, I work for Cheba Hut on Pearl Street.</p>
