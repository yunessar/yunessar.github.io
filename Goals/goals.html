        <h3>My Goals</h3>
        <p>Every day in itself is filled with a list of goals for myself. Like most people, I want to be successful and make an impact.
        </p>

        <p>Success to me however, may appear differently than it does for most people. Since I was young, I struggled heavily with
            my mental health, and goal setting felt impossible when I couldn't even picture the next day. Living in that mentality on the 
            daily forced me to make smaller goals for myself everyday rather than trying to put together the bigger picture. I recognize
            that there are millions of people in this world who are on the same boat as I am, and more than anything I want to prove that 
            we are capable of being more than how our health defines us. I want to be able to <i>create</i> anything and everything I can 
            in this life time that forces people to turn their head for a moment and <i>think</i>. This is what I absolutely love about CTD. 
            Not only is there a strong focus on the aspect of creation, but there is a focus on impact. I'm not sure exactly what it is i'll
            end up doing, but I do know that I can't picture only doing one thing during this lifetime.
