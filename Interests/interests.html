        <h2>My Interests</h2>

        <h3>Hiking</h3>
        <p>It's almost impossible to live in Colorado without loving the outdoors. I enjoy hiking new trails and finding 
            cool spots locally.</p>
        <img src="/Images/painting.jpg" alt="Abstract painting">
        <p>Being in CTD, I would also consider myself to be a decent artist. I've always wanted my art to serve a purpose
            and make an impact, and I'm hoping to be able to find my thing here.
            Currently, I draw memorial portraits for 
            those who have lost loved ones. Although it's slightly morbid, it almost feels like bringing their living presence
            back while emphasizing the smallest details of their features. 
        </p>
        <h3>All the fun stuff</h3>
        <p>I also have a lot of other random smaller hobbies. I'm the kind of person who sees someone do something cool, 
            and I will spend the next few weeks trying to learn that skill myself. I've dabbled in piano, guitar, crotcheting, 
            badminton, gaming, and more. I also absolutely love to bake and cook. Making food has always been a huge part of my
            culture, and it feels like a way of sharing it with other people. I like to bring a little bit of my creativity with 
            me every day, whether that's creating a new recipe or trying a crazy makeup look.
